Welcome to $\binom{\mathcal{Math}}{\text{down}}$.  Supported Markdown syntax:

# A 1st level header
## A 2nd level header etc... (TODO: decreasing fonts)

**Bold** and *italic* text.  _Underscores_ also create italic but please use *asterisks*.

Use $\LaTeX$ syntax for inline math: $\sum_y^z dollars$ or \( \int_u^v backslash\ parens \) 
and for display math:
\[\int_d^e backslash\ brackets\]
or
$$\sum_b^c double\ dollars$$

**How to edit formulas**: Just move the cursor into the formula using arrow keys, and you'll be able to edit it.
It'll render as math as soon as move the cursor outside.
TRY IT NOW!

 - **Lists** are created by space, bullet, space where "bullet" is * or - or number period.  *There must be an empty line before the list.*

    1. Numbered lists also work.
    2. To nest lists just indent them by 4 spaces.
        + 8 spaces for more nested etc...
