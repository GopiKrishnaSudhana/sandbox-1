A 1st level header
==================

A 2nd level header etc...
-------------------------

**Bold** and *italic* text.

Use `\LaTeX` syntax surrounded by backticks for inline math: `\sum_y^z backticks`
and ``.. math::`` directive for display math:

.. math::

  \int_d^e backslash\ brackets

- **Lists** are created by + or * or - bullets.  *There must be an empty line before the list.*

    1. Numbered lists also work.
    2. To nest lists just indent them more spaces.
        + 8 spaces for more nested etc...
