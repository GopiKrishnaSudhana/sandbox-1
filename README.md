=======

Dummy project to test various aspects of github and integrations with it.

## markdown

README processed by Jekyll into https://cben.github.io/sandbox/README

MathJax loaded in output via Jekyll template `_layouts/default.html`.

Delimiters [recognized by kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#math-blocks):

inline $$ \frac{kram}{down} \sum_0^\infty $$ ?

$$ \frac{kram}{down} \sum_0^\infty $$

The second is display math because it occurs alone in a block.

## LaTeX

Example content taken from Authorea.  Currently only `test.tex` is used.
