Yay, `json/index.json` works similar to `index.html` — gets served at https://github-cben-sandbox.anat-beni.net/json/ (aka https://cben.github.io/sandbox/json/) — but with `content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8` !

It's also 301 redirected from https://github-cben-sandbox.anat-beni.net/json .

This file is deliberately not named `README.md` because that got served instead of `index.json`.
